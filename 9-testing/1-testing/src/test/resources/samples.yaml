  - The process of photosynthesis allows plants to convert sunlight into energy. This
    process takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells using chlorophyll. Water,
    carbon dioxide, and sunlight are essential for this transformation.
  expected-output: '- Photosynthesis converts sunlight into plant energy.

    - Occurs in chloroplasts using chlorophyll.

    - Requires water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight.

    - Supports plant growth and oxygen release.

    - Essential for life on Earth.'

  parameters:
  - Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.
    These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But
    since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver, primarily due to
    burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
  expected-output: '- Climate change involves long-term temperature and weather shifts.

    - It can occur naturally via solar cycle changes.

    - Since the 1800s, humans are the main contributors.

    - Burning fossil fuels is a major cause.

    - It leads to global environmental impacts.'
