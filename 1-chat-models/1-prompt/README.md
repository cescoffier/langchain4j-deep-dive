# Prompts

All these examples use [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/) to execute. If you don't have it installed you need to [download/install it](https://www.jbang.dev/download/).

Then run each example just by doing `jbang <filename>`

For example, `jbang Prompt.java`

There isn't a way to run these against a local Ollama without changing the source code.
